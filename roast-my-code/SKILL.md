# roast-my-code

Roast the target codebase with devastating accuracy and actionable fixes.

## Usage

```
/roast                              # Review cwd at spicy level
/roast src/                         # Review src/ directory
/roast --level=savage               # Maximum roast intensity
/roast src/ --level=sensei          # TDD-focused wisdom
```

## Levels

| Level | Tone | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| gentle | Friendly mentor | Juniors, OSS contributors |
| **spicy** | Sarcastic reviewer (default) | Daily use, team reviews |
| savage | Brutally honest senior | Content, self-roasts |
| sensei | TDD master (t_wada style) | TDD adoption, testing culture |

## Instructions

Follow these steps precisely. Do NOT skip any step.

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse the user's input to extract:

- `TARGET_PATH`: directory or file to review (default: current working directory)
- `LEVEL`: one of gentle/spicy/savage/sensei (default: spicy)
- `OUTPUT_LANG`: detect from the user's message language (en or ja).
  If the user wrote in Japanese, set to ja. Otherwise, set to en.

If `--level=` is found anywhere in the argument string, extract its value.
Everything else is treated as the target path.

### Step 2: Project Detection

Analyze the target to detect the project type. Run these checks:

```
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/package.json
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/tsconfig.json
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/Cargo.toml
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/go.mod
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/requirements.txt
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/pyproject.toml
Glob: TARGET_PATH/**/*.sln
Glob: TARGET_PATH/.git
```

Read the **root-level** `package.json` (at `TARGET_PATH/package.json`) first.
If none exists, fall back to the nearest `package.json` to TARGET_PATH.
Extract:

- `dependencies` and `devDependencies` keys
- `scripts` keys
- `engines` field

Detect frameworks by checking dependency names:

- **HTTP frameworks:** express, hono, fastify, koa, @nestjs/core
- **Frontend frameworks:** react, vue, svelte, @angular/core, next, nuxt
- **Test frameworks:** jest, vitest, mocha, @testing-library/*
- **Language:** presence of tsconfig.json = TypeScript

Store results as:

- `LANG`: typescript | javascript | rust | go | python | csharp | unknown
- `HAS_TESTS`: boolean
- `HAS_HTTP_FRAMEWORK`: boolean
- `HAS_FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK`: boolean
- `HAS_GIT`: boolean
- `HAS_PACKAGE_MANIFEST`: boolean

### Step 3: Checker Activation

Determine which checkers to run based on detection results:

| Checker | Reference File | Condition |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Security | `references/security.md` | Always |
| Architecture | `references/architecture.md` | Always |
| Complexity | `references/complexity.md` | Always |
| TDD | `references/tdd.md` | Always |
| Type Safety | `references/type-safety.md` | LANG = typescript OR .ts/.tsx files found |
| Error Handling | `references/error-handling.md` | Always |
| Naming | `references/naming.md` | Always |
| Dead Code | `references/dead-code.md` | Always |
| Performance | `references/performance.md` | Always |
| Dependencies | `references/dependencies.md` | HAS_PACKAGE_MANIFEST |
| API Design | `references/api-design.md` | HAS_HTTP_FRAMEWORK |
| Frontend | `references/frontend.md` | HAS_FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK |
| Git Hygiene | `references/git-hygiene.md` | HAS_GIT |

Also read `references/roast-style.md` to load the persona for the selected LEVEL.

### Step 4: Execute Each Checker

For each active checker:

1. Read the checker's reference file from the `references/` directory.
2. For each check item in the file, use the detection method described:
   - Use **Grep** to search for patterns in source files.
   - Use **Glob** to find files matching patterns.
   - Use **Bash** for line counts, git log analysis, or file size checks.
3. Record each finding with:
   - `category`: checker name
   - `check`: check item name
   - `severity`: critical / error / warning / info
   - `location`: file path and line number(s)
   - `evidence`: the actual code/pattern found
   - `deduction`: point deduction value

**Important rules:**

- Only report findings backed by actual evidence found in the code.
- Do NOT invent findings for entertainment. Every roast must be grounded in fact.
- **Deduplication:** If the same issue appears in multiple checkers (e.g.,
  CORS in Security and API Design, Error Boundaries in Error Handling and
  Frontend), count the deduction in only ONE category — whichever is more
  specific. Note the cross-reference in the other category without deducting.
- Sample up to 20 files per checker to keep analysis tractable.
- For large projects, prioritize: src/ > lib/ > app/ > other directories.
- Skip node_modules/, dist/, build/, .next/, vendor/, target/ directories.

### Step 5: Calculate Scores

For each active checker category:

1. Start at **100 points**.
2. Apply deductions for each finding:
   - `critical`: **-20** points
   - `error`: **-10** points
   - `warning`: **-4** points
   - `info`: **-1** point
3. **Per-check cap:** Max **3 findings** per check type count toward the
   score. Additional instances are reported but do not deduct further points.
4. Floor at **0** (no negative scores).
5. The category score displayed in the table is always out of **100**
   (do NOT multiply by weight here).

Calculate the **Overall Score** using category weights:

- Weights: Security **1.5x**, Architecture **1.2x**,
  TDD **1.5x** in sensei mode (1.0x otherwise), all others **1.0x**.
- `overall = sum(score_i * weight_i) / sum(weight_i)`
- Weights are used ONLY in this overall calculation, not on individual
  category scores.

Determine the **Grade**:

| Grade | Score Range | Label |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| S | 90 - 100 | Immaculate |
| A | 80 - 89 | Solid |
| B | 70 - 79 | Decent |
| C | 60 - 69 | Needs Work |
| D | 40 - 59 | Rough |
| F | 0 - 39 | Dumpster Fire |

### Step 6: Generate Output

Compose the final output using the Output Format below.
Apply the roast persona from roast-style.md for the selected LEVEL.

**Rules:**

- Every finding gets a roast line AND a concrete fix.
- Group findings by category.
- Show the most critical findings first within each category.
- Keep total output under 300 lines. If more findings exist, show top 5 per
  category and note how many were omitted.
- Lines should be under 80 characters where possible for screenshot-friendliness.
- **Language:** If `OUTPUT_LANG` is ja, write all roast lines, fix descriptions,
  summary text, and section labels in Japanese. Category names in the scorecard
  table and structural elements (box-drawing, header) remain in English.
  If `OUTPUT_LANG` is en, write everything in English.

### Output Rules

1. **Scorecard table** always appears first.
2. **Findings** are grouped by category, ordered by score
   (worst category first).
3. Within each category, findings are ordered: critical > error >
   warning > info.
4. **Summary** always appears last.
5. If a category scored 100 (no findings), show it in the table
   but skip the findings section for it. Add it to Strengths.
6. The roast line MUST match the selected LEVEL's tone from
   roast-style.md.
7. Every roast MUST be paired with a Fix.
8. Use box-drawing characters for the table exactly as shown.
9. If the overall grade is S, add a congratulatory roast:
   "I came here to roast, but your code left me speechless.
   Well played."

## Scoring Quick Reference

| Severity | Deduction | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| critical | -20 | Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, no tests |
| error | -10 | Empty catch, God files, `any` abuse |
| warning | -4 | console.log, TODO comments, inline styles |
| info | -1 | Missing engine field, no readonly |

| Weight | Category | Multiplier | Note |
|--------|----------|-----------|------|
| High | Security | 1.5x | Always |
| Medium | Architecture | 1.2x | Always |
| Elevated | TDD | 1.5x | sensei mode only (1.0x otherwise) |

**Note:** Weights apply ONLY to the overall weighted average, not to
individual category scores (which are always displayed out of 100).
Per-check cap: max 3 findings per check type count toward the score.
